* Directions:
*   1. create a working Java program to complete this assignment
*   2. Some questions do not require code and may be answered using
*       comments or printing to stdout (System.out)
*   3. Unless they have a return value, all functions should be void type

    * D.) Write a function that declars an int and initializes it with a 
    * a char value (e.g. 'A'). Print the value of your variable
    *
    * Why does it have that value?

    * E.) Write a function with one parameter (String name) and prints the

    * F.) Write a function that decalres and intializes a string and prints
    * its value to standard output (System.out)

    /*
    * G.) Write a function with two paramters (int a, int b) and returns their
    * sum. Output the return value in main.
